                                       The input node 'Routing_using_memory_cache.Queue: ROUTING.REFRESH.IN1' detected an error whilst processing a message.  The message flow has been rolled-back and, if the message was being processed in a unit of work, it will remain on the input queue to be processed again.  Following messages will indicate the cause of this exception.
                                       Check the error messages which follow to determine why the exception was generated, and take action as described by those messages.

                                       The message broker detected an error whilst processing a message in node 'Routing_using_memory_cache.Queue: ROUTING.REFRESH.OUT1'. An exception has been thrown to cut short the processing of the message.

2008-04-23 14:22:25.594488      400   MessageException  BIP2660E: The message received at output node 'Routing_using_memory_cache.Queue: ROUTING.REFRESH.OUT1' is empty. State = '-1' ''MQW001'' '0' ''''
                                       The WebSphere Message Brokers output node 'Routing_using_memory_cache.Queue: ROUTING.REFRESH.OUT1' has received a message for writing to a queue, but the message's bit stream is too short to be a valid message. This situation can occur when a message is built incorrectly by a Compute node (e.g. there is no MQMD).
                                       Check the message flow to determine whether the message is being built correctly, correct the problem and redeploy.
2008-04-23 14:22:26.598590      400   Error       BIP2648E: Message backed out to a queue; node 'Routing_using_memory_cache.Queue: ROUTING.REFRESH.IN1'.
                                       Node 'Routing_using_memory_cache.Queue: ROUTING.REFRESH.IN1' has received a message which has previously been backed out one or more times because of a processing error in the main path of the message flow. The failure terminal is not attached, so the message broker is putting the message directly to the requeue or dead letter backout queue associated with this node. The MQMD 'backoutCount' of the message now equals the 'backoutThreshold' defined for the WebSphere MQ input queue.
                                       Examine previous messages and the message flow to determine why the message is being backed out.  Correct this situation if possible.  Perform any local error recovery processing required.

                                       Message backout processing has been invoked, and the message has either been backed out by being written to the backout requeue or dead letter queue, as determined by the WebSphere MQ queue manager and queue configuration.
                                       No user action required.
